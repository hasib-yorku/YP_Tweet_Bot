A Twitter bot built using JavaScript that replies to users' shopping needs. Users can tweet "I want to buy _____" to the #askYP hashtag and the bot will use Yellow Pages API to find current deals on the item and reply to the tweet. Built for Yellow Page's challenge at Concordia University's annual hackathon (ConUHacks 2017).
